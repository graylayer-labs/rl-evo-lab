## Project Overview

Reproduction and extension of MSc thesis: *"Improving Exploration in Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning through Novelty Search"* (NUI Galway, 2021).

The core algorithm is **EDER** (Evolutionary Distributed Experience Replay): a gradient-based DRL learner (DQN) combined with an Evolution Strategy (ES) actor population. The ES fills the replay buffer with diverse experiences; the learner trains purely from that buffer — no epsilon-greedy exploration.

- Python `>=3.12`, managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

## Common Commands

```bash
poetry install          # Install dependencies
poetry add <package>    # Add a dependency
poetry run pytest       # Run tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_foo.py::test_bar  # Run single test
```

## Architecture

### Key design invariants
- **Learner and actor are independently swappable** — the replay buffer is the only interface between them
- **Augmented reward is internal to the actor** — the learner always trains on extrinsic reward only
- **ES rollouts fill the buffer exclusively** — the learner does not store its own episodes

### Learner (DQN → SAC/DDPG)
Standard DQN (policy net + target net). Only interacts with the environment for evaluation. Updated via batches sampled from the shared replay buffer (MSE loss + Adam).

### Actor (Evolution Strategy — Salimans et al. 2017)
Each episode: generates N noisy parameter vectors (θ + σε, ε ~ N(0,1)), scores each on augmented reward, updates θ toward best-performing directions. Periodically syncs back to learner weights to prevent divergence.

### Augmented Reward
```
rₐ = rₑ + β · rᵢ
```
- `rᵢ` = KNN distance over an **episodic** memory of controllable-state embeddings (reset each episode)
- Controllable states: embeddings from a network trained to predict the action taken between (sₜ, sₜ₊₁)
- Only extrinsic transitions are pushed to the replay buffer

### Key hyperparameters
| Param | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| σ | 0.06 | ES noise std dev — best from original experiments |
| β | 0.02 | Intrinsic reward weight |
| N workers | 50 | ES population size |
| Sync freq τ | 25 eps | Actor → learner weight sync |

## Logging
Track these separately — they tell very different stories:
- Actor (augmented) reward per episode
- Learner evaluation reward
- Mean worker reward across population
- Replay buffer diversity metric

Always seed everything and log σ and β per run.

## Current Roadmap
1. Clean EDER reproduction (DQN + ES, CartPole)
2. Swap DQN learner for SAC or DDPG (continuous action spaces)
3. Test on MuJoCo locomotion / sparse reward tasks
4. Add lifelong novelty module (RND-based) alongside episodic KNN

## rl-core

This repo does **not yet use rl-core** — it has its own implementations of replay buffer, DQN network, logging, and seeding. These are candidates for migration:

| Local impl | rl-core equivalent |
|---|---|
| `src/rl_evo_lab/buffer/replay_buffer.py` | `rl_core.buffers.ReplayBuffer` |
| `src/rl_evo_lab/learner/network.py` (QNetwork + FlatParams) | `rl_core.algorithms.dqn.QNetwork` |
| `src/rl_evo_lab/utils/seeding.py` | `rl_core.utils.seed_everything` |
| `src/rl_evo_lab/utils/logging.py` (RunLogger) | `rl_core.experiments.RunManager` + `NamespacedLogger` |

Before migrating, verify that rl-core's version covers the local usage. The local `ReplayBuffer` has a `diversity_metric()` method that rl-core's does not — open a change request if that's needed.

To add rl-core as a dependency:
```toml
"rl-core @ git+https://github.com/graylayer-labs/rl-core.git@v1.0.0"
```

Key metric separation for this repo (use `NamespacedLogger`):
- **`algo/`**: `learner_loss`, `q_mean`, `q_target_mean`
- **`research/`**: `idn_loss`, `effective_beta`, `buffer_diversity`, `actor_augmented_reward`
- **bare**: `actor_extrinsic_reward`, `learner_eval_reward`, `episode`, `sync`

Logging `actor_extrinsic_reward` and `learner_eval_reward` in the bare namespace (not algo/ or research/) is intentional — they are the primary outcome metrics and should be immediately visible.
